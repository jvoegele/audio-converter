# audio-converter

Convert your entire music collection to any number of different formats.

`audio-converter` can take your source audio files and convert them to various
output formats for different music players or cloud services. For example, you
can convert to AAC for your Apple devices, or Ogg Vorbis for Android or Linux
devices, or MP3 for the plethora of devices and supported that support MP3.
Furthermore, you can convert to multiple different formats at once so that you
have copies of your entire music library in any format you wish.

`audio-converter` not only converts the audio data to different formats but
also preserves all of the metadata in the audio files. So if you've
meticulously tagged your music library with metadata, such as artist sort order,
genre, etc., you can rest assured that `audio-converter` will preserve that
metadata in the target formats, at least insofar as the target format allows.
(Some formats do not offer flexible metadata tagging facilities, unfortunately.)
